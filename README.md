# Word-Guess-Game
This is a Dungeons and Dragons based Word guessing Game.
The player plays by typing one letter at a time on the keyboard, trying to guess the word correctly.  If a letter they enter is correct, it will replace a line hiding the word at its location in the word.
If the guess is incorrect, the letter will be added to the guessed letters box.
If the player guesses the word before 10 wrong guesses, then the player wins the game, and a new game will start, with their number of wins becoming recorded.
After 10 guesses, and the word is not complete, the player loses that round, and a new game will start, with a new word chosen.
Enjoy!
